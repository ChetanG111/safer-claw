user clicks deploy -> takes to login screen w/ different options -> user logs in -> user is redirected to dashboard -> shows agent config screen -> user selects a config -> user is redirected to payment screen -> user completes payment -> user is redirected to dashboard -> user's agent is now ready and all the basic info shows up on the dashboard.

once the user has an agent up and running all the CTA shows up as "go to dashboard"
