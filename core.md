We are launching a lightweight SaaS that lets non-technical users deploy their own private AI agent (like OpenClaw-style agents) in one click and connect it directly to messaging platforms such as Telegram or WhatsApp. Instead of selling “setup,” the core promise is giving small teams, solo founders, and operators a controlled, secure AI assistant that can run workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and act like a digital employee inside their existing chat tools.

The initial go-to-market strategy is to validate demand fast by targeting people who are already experimenting with AI agents but struggle with infrastructure, permissions, reliability, and cost control. We will launch quickly with a single low-priced weekly plan to reduce friction and get the first 10 paying users for validation. Distribution will focus on high-intent communities (builder and operator spaces like Reddit and indie founder circles), plus selective partnerships with influencers who have non-technical but AI-curious business audiences.

The product’s positioning is not “one-click deploy,” but “your private, safe, controllable AI operator inside your business inbox.” Early success will be measured by: number of waitlist signups, first paid conversions, and proof that users trust us to run an AI agent connected to their real workflows.
